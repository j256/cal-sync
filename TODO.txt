- database of calendars that we are reading from
	- how do we authenticate against each one of them?
- read all future calendar entries (or maybe those after yesterday or something)
	- we don't want to have old entries removed from their calendar be necessarily removed from central
	- maybe have an archive calendar or something
- hopefully the google cal entries will have a unique idea
- central database that allows me to edit an entry:
	- add a type do it
	- add a location
	- filter it
	- add an attachment
- pay attention to the public/private flag on the entry
- have a keyword in the description:
	- corresponds to a destination calendar
	- gvpcal
	- maybe make it a guest: gvp@...com
- have a table of calendars
	- calendars can have an assumed keyword (GVP)
- look forward only X months (maybe a year?)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- create a google calendar
- give access to a specific user-id that the syncer uses:
	uploader@lexington-calendar-sync-256503.iam.gserviceaccount.com
- the syncer is configured with that "source" calendar id (i.e. your email address)
	- has a organization ("Follen Church", "Temple Isaiah")
- calendar has an optional default-category ("GVP")
	- without the default category, "misc" is assumed
	- with a default category, all events in that calendar will be associated with the category
- the syncer is configured with destination calendars
	- all events from the source calendars are copied into the destination calendars 
- syncer also configured with a list of keywords that when included in the description of a calendar entry
	turn it into a category
	- entries can have multiple categories (homelessness and food-insecurity)
- syncer adds to the bottom of each copied event:
	- organization the originated it
	- event-id that originated it

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- list all entries since the beginning of time (maybe start a month back or something)
- need to have the source organization at the bottom of the event if the dest-cal isn't an org dest-cal
