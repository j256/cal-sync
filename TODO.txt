- read all future calendar entries (or maybe those after yesterday or something)
	- we don't want to have old entries removed from their calendar be necessarily removed from central
	- maybe have an archive calendar or something
- central database that allows me to edit an entry:
	- add a type do it
	- add a location
	- filter it
	- add an attachment
- pay attention to the public/private flag on the entry
- look forward only X months (maybe a year?)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- list all entries since the beginning of time (maybe start a month back or something)
- how do we handle having a contact (the leader) and how to protect their personal information
- maybe have explicit sync rules:
	- this calendar goes to that one but only if a category is set but goes into this other calendar regardless
